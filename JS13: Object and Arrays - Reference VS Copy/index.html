    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const copy = players;

    console.log(players, copy);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    copy[3] = "anouar";
    console.log(players, copy);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const copy2 = players.slice();
    copy2[3] = 'lux';
    console.log(players, copy2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy3 = [].concat(players);
    copy3[3] = 'hal';
    console.log(players, copy3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy4 = [...players];
    copy4[3] = 'ES6';
    console.log(players, copy4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap = person;
    cap.age = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap1 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 299});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap2 = {...person};// is not in javascript 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
